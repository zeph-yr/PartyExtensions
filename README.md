# PartyExtensions
**This mod extends play stats that are saved to the local leaderboard when playing in Party Mode. Adds trackers for pure left and right hand accuracy, score and accuracy before and after modifiers, and more.**

## How To Use
- Unzip PartyExtensions.zip in your Beat Saber directory
- Play a map in Party Mode and click on the purple heart-cube ðŸ’Ÿ icon on the leaderboard to see detailed stats
- Existing scores on base game party leaderboard will be without extended data until they are played over
- Optional: To generate the first backup of your existing base game party scores, set at least 1 score with PartyExtensions, then quit and restart game.

## Scores and Saved Data
- Scores are saved in `/UserData/PartyExtensions`
- **Pressing the Trashcan button on leaderboard will delete ALL party score data** (this is base game behavior)

### For Advanced Users
- PartyExtensions "backs up" your data at the launch of each game. If you accidentally clicked the Trashcan, you can retrieve the `.bak` files in `/UserData/PartyExtensions/`
- **To restore, you MUST retrieve the `.bak` files BEFORE the next time you launch the game.** Save copies of the `.bak` files to another directory just in case. Rename the files in `/UserData/PartyExtensions/` to without the `.bak` ending. Do the same with the base game files `LocalLeaderboards.dat.bak`, `LocalDailyLeaderboard.dat.bak` and put them in your `AppData` folder.
- **If the scores are important to you, please make your own backups. Don't forget base game AppData. They must be copied at the same time to be useable.** The mod's feature mitigates user error and is not meant for actual backup!
- **Note:** If you uninstall PartyExtensions and play in Party Mode, then reinstall PartyExtensions later, the data may be desynced. While knowledgeable users may possibly repair, this is exceedingly difficult and not advised. If you need to uninstall PartyExtensions, back up first so you can restore, else delete the old PartyExtensions files when you reinstall the mod.
